## Description

This is a webpage for Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc. with the aim to improve your understanding of Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. I was tasked with making the html clear and semantic; also to improve the stylesheet so that it was concise and without unnecissary repitition. This project shows my ability to understand html and CSS.
